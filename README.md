![Delphi Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/badge/Delphi%20Supported%20Versions-XE10.3..11-blue.svg)
![Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/Supported%20platforms-Win32%20and%20Win64-red.svg)

Welcome to the Setup4DCEP project repository! This application was developed to streamline the search for CEP (ZIP code) and IBGE codes (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). With Setup4DCEP, you can perform interactions with procedures and functions in your Delphi applications quickly, simply, and reliably.

## üìê How to Use

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Automatic (via boss)

* Using [**Boss**](https://github.com/HashLoad/boss) is recommended to simplify the installation of Setup4DCEP. Just run the following command in a terminal, such as Windows PowerShell, to perform the installation more conveniently:

   ```shell
   boss install github.com/Setup4D/Setup4DCEP
   ```

   + This automates the installation process and dependency management, making the Setup4DCEP configuration simpler. Make sure that Boss is set up and ready for use in your Delphi environment before running this command.

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Manual (Delphi)

* If you choose to install manually, follow the steps below:

   1. Download the project from [here](https://github.com/Setup4D/Setup4DCEP/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
   2. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder of your choice.
   3. Add the extracted folder to your project by following the steps below:

      1. In Delphi, go to the "Project" menu.
      2. Select "Options."
      3. In the options panel, navigate to "Resource Compiler."
      4. Under "Directories and Conditionals," choose "Include file search path."
      5. Click "Browse" and add the folder extracted from the project.

         + This will enable your project to access the necessary files and resources from Setup4DCEP. Be sure to save the settings after following these steps.

            ```
            .\{Folder}\src
            .\{Folder}\src\requires\inc
            .\{Folder}\src\requires\ACBrComum
            .\{Folder}\src\requires\ACBrTCP

            .\{Folder}\src\Result\IBGE
            .\{Folder}\src\Result\Zip Code
           ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

* This project relies on [**Setup4DUtility**](https://github.com/Setup4D/Setup4DUtility), playing a crucial role in its operational functionalities. When using [**Boss**](https://github.com/HashLoad/boss) as the framework installer, the installation of **Setup4DUtility** happens automatically. However, if you prefer a manual installation, follow the steps below:

   1. Download the project from [**here**](https://github.com/Setup4D/Setup4DUtility/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or visit the [**project page**](https://github.com/Setup4D/Setup4DUtility) and download it.
   2. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder of your choice.
   3. Add the extracted folder to your project by going to *Project > Options > Resource Compiler > Directories and Conditionals > Include file search path*.<p>

   ```
   ./{Folder}/src
   ```

## üìê Usage Mode

### ‚öôÔ∏è Language of Messages

* The system supports two languages, with English being the default language. However, it's possible to use the application in Brazilian Portuguese. To do so, follow the steps below:

   * **Option 1: Configuration via Delphi:**
   
      ```
      Go to Project > Options > Delphi Compiler > Conditionals Defines
      ```

      1. In Delphi, go to the "Project" menu.
      2. Select "Options."
      3. In the options panel, navigate to "Delphi Compiler."
      4. Under "Conditionals Defines," add the directive *HAS_PORTUGUES*.

         + This will allow the application to be used in Brazilian Portuguese. Remember to save the settings and recompile the project after making these changes.

   * **Option 2: Manual Configuration:**

      1. Ensure that the line *{$DEFINE HAS_PORTUGUES}* in the file *Setup4DCEPLanguage.inc*, located in *.\{folder}\src\requires\inc*, is uncommented (i.e., without the double slashes "//").

         + This will also enable the application to be used in Brazilian Portuguese. Don't forget to save the changes and recompile the project for the settings to take effect.
